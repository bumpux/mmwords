#  Unicode Characters (UTF-8 and beyond)

Unicode does define some other characters which are sort of Mac-specific.

⌘ - &#x2318; - &#8984; - the Command Key symbol
⌥ - &#x2325; - &#8997; - the Option Key symbol
⇧ - &#x21E7; - &#8679; - the Shift Key (really just an outline up-arrow, not Mac-specific)
⎋ - &#x238B; - &#9099; - the Escape Key ?? Power??

⇥ - &#x21E5; - &#8677; - the Tab Key symbol
⏎ - &#x23CE; - &#9166; - the Return Key symbol
⌫ - &#x232B; - &#9003; - the Delete Key symbol
⌽ - &#x233D; - &#9021; - a possible substitute for the Power symbol

⌽ - looks like the IEC 5010 power symbol 

(␛) - &#x241B; 

alternate Option btn: ⎇

alternate Tab: ⌦

Control: ⌃

⌦ is achieved by "fn ⌫" ☺ 

It's also interesting that Apple uses 

↖ for Home 
↘ for End 
⇞ for Page Up 
⇟ for Page Down 
⌤ for Enter (even though its use is not consistent app to app) 
⇪  - CAPS LOCK would be unicode U+21EA, &#x21EA; &#8682; 

[Extracted from here][8]. Gory details and some peeves. Sum: these seem widespread enough to use without worry now.
